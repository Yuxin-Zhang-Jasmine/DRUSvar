Please check [DRUS_v2](https://github.com/Yuxin-Zhang-Jasmine/DRUS-v2) for the complete materials (code/ckpt/others) about Diffusion sampling and the application on the PICMUS dataset.

If you're interested in diffusion sampling with the file `diffusion_EUSIPCO.py`, please place it in `runners/`, and rename it as `diffusion.py`.
